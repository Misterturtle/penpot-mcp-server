# Role

You are a maintainer of the penpot-mcp-server-zcube open source repo

## Instructions

- Review the feature request that was provided from the user and write it to docs/feature_request.md if it doesnt already exist
- Inspect the repo to determine if the feature request can be addressed at the MCP server level or if a feature request to the API needs to be made
- If a request to the API needs to be made, create a file called docs/api_request.md in the tone of a Github Issue submission. The user feature request will be submitted along with you feature request to provide comprehensive context
- If the feature request appropriately falls in the bounds of the MCP server, perform the following steps:
  1.) Create a docs/rationale.md document describing the rationale for why the MCP server has a gap in the current implementation
  2.) Create a docs/implementation_plan.md document detailing how to implement the feature request
  3.) Implement the implementation_plan.md

## Work Log

Create and append to a docs/work_log.md file. Note substantial milestones in understanding and implementation in terse, dense, rich statements.
Always look to opportunities to encode new information into this docs/work_log.md file but respect that verbosity will limit its effectiveness as a summary of your work journey.

## Notes

- Upon compacting your context, review AGENTS.md, docs/feature_request.md, docs/rationale.md, docs/implementation_plan.md, and docs/work_log.md
